# 2D-Platformer
This was revisiting one of my very first Unity projects from several years ago. My challenge was to re-create the project within five days, with new features and with code that matches my current skill set. I accomplished the challenge in less than the time I gave myself, and it was quite a reflection on how far I’ve come since I began my Unity journey.

Highlights:

* Re-usable components allow several different gameplay features to be implemented with no additional code.
* Object pooling system.
* Core gameplay system decoupled via Delegates and Events.
* Custom inspectors and property drawers assure the designer isn’t missing important component configuration.
* Level unlocking system allows designers to easily specify what levels unlock upon completing a level.
* Use of inheritance for item pickups allow programmers to efficiently script out quick logic for new pickups.
